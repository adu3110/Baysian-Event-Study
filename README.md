# Baysian-Event-Study
Event studies have become one of the most important methodological tools to empirical research in finance and accounting. This thesis focuses on refining and developing the Event Study Methodology (ESM, henceforth) for studying the impact of an event (specifically Mergers and acquisitions) on stock returns.First the problem of event study (ES, henceforth) is properly formulated as a statistical hypothesis testing problem, in light of which the existing ESM are examined. Next, based on this formulation, standard method of moments, likelihoods as well as Bayesian tests are developed. While developing these methods under existing assumptions, of no change in volatility post an event, aforementioned statistical method have also been extended by relaxing this constraint, and developing them under the empirically observed phenomenon of simultaneous change in volatility after the occurrence of the event of interest. The developed methodologies are numerically illustrated by analyzing the real data set on Mergers and Acquisitions of companies listed in the Indian equity Market of the NSE. The results showed that Mergers and Acquisitions announcement had significant positive impact on the valuation of the Acquirer firm on the event day.
